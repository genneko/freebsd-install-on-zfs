# freebsd-install-on-zfs
FreeBSD ZFS custom installation script for use with bsdinstall.

## Quick Start
Basically, you need two hosts which can commnicate each other. One is a host to which you install FreeBSD ("Target" here) and the other is a host which provides the first one with this install script ("Provider" here). The latter may be your laptop or anything like that.

### Provider (hosting scripts to Target)
1. Clone this repository on the Provider.
```
provider$ cd ~/tmp
provider$ git clone https://github.com/genneko/freebsd-install-on-zfs.git
```

2. Copy/rename sample \*.cfg/scp files and edit them as needed.
```
provider$ cd freebsd-install-on-zfs
provider$ cp baremetal.cfg.sample myserver.cfg
provider$ cp body.scp.sample body.scp
provider$ cp post.scp.sample post.scp
provider$ vi myserver.cfg
provider$ vi body.scp
provider$ vi post.scp
```

3. Start a web server to host this repository contents, more specifically install.sh and \*.cfg/scp files. Off course, you can also put those files into your existing web server's document directory instead of newly starting a service.

One way to do this is using the python's built-in web server module as follows.
```
provider$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

### Target (a host to install FreeBSD on)
1. Boot the Target with a FreeBSD installer.

2. Go into shell at the welcome dialog.

3. Do the basic network and other configurations.
```
# dhclient em0
```
or
```
# ifconfig vtnet0 inet 172.16.10.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
# route add default 172.16.10.1
# cat<<EOS>/tmp/bsdinstall_etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 172.16.10.5
nameserver 172.16.20.5
EOS
```

4. Download install.sh and .cfg file from the Provider. Note that you don't have to download \*.scp files because they are automatically downloaded in the second phase of the installtion process.
```
# cd /tmp
# fetch http://target.example.com:8000/install.sh
# fetch http://target.example.com:8000/myserver.cfg
```

5. Set the CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE to .cfg filename and export it.
```
# export CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE=myserver.cfg
```

6. Run bsdinstall with the script.
If you set ZFSBOOT_GELI_ENCRYPTION to 1, you will be asked a passphrase for GELI.
```
# bsinstall script install.sh
```

7. Check a log file generated by bsdinstall.
```
# less bsdinstall_log
```

8. Reboot into the newly installed system.
If you enabled GELI encryption, you will be asked a passphrase in the earliest stage of boot process.
```
# shutdown -r now
```

9. After the first boot, login as a DEFAULT_USER_NAME and perform necessary configurations as usual. You can also automate some of those tasks by customizing post.scp.
```
$ sudo passwd root
$ passwd freebsd

$ sudo sysrc ntpd_enable=YES
$ sudo sysrc ntpd_sync_on_start=YES
$ sudo service ntpd start

$ sudo zfs snapshot -r zroot/ROOT/default@install-03user
$ sudo beadm create 11.1

$ sudo freebsd-update fetch install

$ sudo zfs snapshot -r zroot/ROOT/default@install-04up2p4
..
```
